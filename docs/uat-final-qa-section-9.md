# StageLink — UAT & Final QA Section 9

Status: implemented for UAT coverage and final pre-release checklist
Last checked: 2026-05-02

This document records the Section 9 final QA work:

- 9.1 UAT testing: simulate real users, full platform usage, friction findings
- 9.2 Final QA + smoke pre-release: smoke, critical flows, regression and
  production readiness

## Scope

Section 9 is the release-candidate layer that sits above the focused sections:

- Sections 1-4: base QA, unit, integration/API and E2E
- Section 6: security
- Section 7: performance
- Section 8: data/reliability

The goal is not to duplicate every test. The goal is to run the right
combination, capture friction, and produce a human-readable sign-off.

## Fixes Applied

| Finding                                                                                                                 | Impact                                                               | Fix                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessibility specs existed under `e2e/accessibility`, but `playwright.config.ts` did not register them in any project. | Accessibility regression tests were not executed by `pnpm test:e2e`. | Added `accessibility-public` and credential-gated `accessibility-authenticated` Playwright projects. |
| Accessibility specs imported `@axe-core/playwright`, but the root dev dependency was missing.                           | Enabling the specs would fail in CI.                                 | Added `@axe-core/playwright` as a root dev dependency.                                               |
| No UAT-specific E2E project existed.                                                                                    | Real-user friction checks were buried inside lower-level E2E suites. | Added `e2e/uat/real-user-journey.spec.ts` and included it in the public UAT project.                 |
| No final QA command existed.                                                                                            | Pre-release validation required remembering several project names.   | Added `pnpm test:e2e:uat` and `pnpm test:e2e:final`.                                                 |

## UAT Coverage

Automated UAT file:

```text
e2e/uat/real-user-journey.spec.ts
```

Covered journeys:

| User        | Journey                            | Coverage                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New artist  | Landing → pricing → signup → login | Ensures offer discovery and account entry points are reachable.             |
| Fan/visitor | Public artist page inspection      | Ensures a demo public profile renders and exposes actionable content links. |

Manual UAT should still be run with real users or the product owner because
friction, wording and trust cues are partly subjective.

## Commands

UAT:

```bash
E2E_DEMO_ARTIST=free-artist-qa pnpm test:e2e:uat
```

Final pre-release public/non-mutating pass:

```bash
E2E_DEMO_ARTIST=free-artist-qa pnpm test:e2e:final
```

Full staging E2E including authenticated flows:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://staging.stagelink.link \
E2E_DEMO_ARTIST=free-artist-qa \
E2E_AUTH_EMAIL=artist-e2e@example.com \
E2E_AUTH_PASSWORD=... \
pnpm test:e2e
```

Production smoke only:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://stagelink.art pnpm test:e2e:smoke
```

## Playwright Projects

| Project                       | Auth               | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `smoke`                       | No                 | Production-safe smoke checks.            |
| `auth-ui`                     | No                 | StageLink-owned login/signup entry UI.   |
| `public`                      | No                 | Public page, business and UAT journeys.  |
| `mobile`                      | No                 | Responsive public regression.            |
| `accessibility-public`        | No                 | Public WCAG/keyboard checks.             |
| `setup`                       | WorkOS credentials | Auth state setup.                        |
| `authenticated`               | WorkOS credentials | Dashboard, onboarding/upload/navigation. |
| `accessibility-authenticated` | WorkOS credentials | Dashboard a11y/keyboard checks.          |

If `E2E_AUTH_EMAIL` and `E2E_AUTH_PASSWORD` are absent, authenticated projects
are intentionally not registered.

## UAT Friction Report Template

Use this table during manual UAT. Entries from the Task 4 Codex-assisted UAT
pass are included below:

| ID      | Persona  | Flow                            | Friction / Issue                                                                                                    | Severity | Evidence                             | Owner  | Status |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| UAT-004 | Artist   | Landing → auth entry            | No blocking friction found in landing, pricing, signup or login entry points.                                       | P3       | `docs/final-qa-task-4-manual-uat.md` | Codex  | closed |
| UAT-005 | Visitor  | Public artist inspection        | No blocking friction found for published demo artist inspection; optional content-dependent checks skipped cleanly. | P3       | `docs/final-qa-task-4-manual-uat.md` | Codex  | closed |
| UAT-006 | Operator | Product-owner copy/trust review | Subjective copy, trust and launch polish review remains available before public launch.                             | P2       | Product-owner manual pass            | Robert | open   |

Severity:

- P0: blocks launch
- P1: critical workflow broken or data/security risk
- P2: meaningful friction or confusing UX
- P3: polish/follow-up

  PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_REPORT=/tmp/stagelink-section9-final-report \
  pnpm exec playwright test --list --project=smoke --project=auth-ui --project=public --project=mobile --project=accessibility-public
```

Results:

- Web unit tests pass: 13 files, 131 tests.
- Integration DB reset coverage passes.
- TypeScript check passes.
- Playwright lists `test:e2e:uat` coverage: 24 tests across auth UI, public,
  mobile and public accessibility projects.
- Playwright lists credential-gated authenticated accessibility coverage: 12
  tests across setup, dashboard axe and dashboard keyboard projects.
- Playwright lists `test:e2e:final` coverage: 27 non-mutating tests including
  smoke, UAT and public accessibility.

No production mutation was performed by this PR.

Additional Task 4 UAT evidence recorded on 2026-05-02:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://stagelink.art \
E2E_DEMO_ARTIST=free-artist-qa \
CI=true \
PLAYWRIGHT_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/stagelink-task4-uat-results \
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_REPORT=/tmp/stagelink-task4-uat-report \
pnpm test:e2e:uat
```

Result: 17 passed, 7 skipped, 0 failed. The skips were optional
content-dependent public journey checks; no P0/P1 UAT issues were found.
