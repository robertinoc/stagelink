# Analytics Data Quality & Consent (T4-4)

## Overview

StageLink persists **every analytics event** — including bots, internal previews, and QA sessions — with quality flags set at write time. Dashboard queries filter on these flags at aggregation time. This preserves the full raw event log for debugging while ensuring artists see clean metrics.

---

## Quality Flags

Five boolean/string columns on `analytics_events`:

| Column                 | Type       | Default        | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `is_bot_suspected`     | `boolean`  | `false`        | UA matched known bot/crawler pattern                               |
| `is_internal`          | `boolean`  | `false`        | Flagged as internal/preview traffic (`X-SL-Internal: 1`)           |
| `is_qa`                | `boolean`  | `false`        | QA session (`X-SL-QA: 1`, set via `?sl_qa=1`)                      |
| `has_tracking_consent` | `boolean?` | `null`         | Visitor consent from `sl_ac` cookie (`null` = unknown/server-side) |
| `environment`          | `string`   | `'production'` | `production` \| `staging` \| `development`                         |

### Dashboard filter (applied at query time)

```sql
WHERE is_bot_suspected = false
  AND is_internal = false
  AND is_qa = false
  AND environment = 'production'
```

All raw events are retained — this filter only applies to aggregation queries in `AnalyticsService.getOverview()`.

---

## Bot Detection

`detectBotFromUserAgent(ua)` in `apps/api/src/common/utils/analytics-flags.ts`:

- Regex matches ~30 known bot/crawler patterns (Googlebot, Baiduspider, curl, Playwright, etc.)
- **Empty UA** → flagged as bot (conservative — real browsers always send a UA)
- False-negative rate is intentionally low: better to count a bot as a real visit than to lose real fan traffic
- PostHog server-side bot filtering provides an independent second layer

---

## Consent Strategy

**Model: explicit opt-in for non-essential analytics.**

StageLink no longer treats an absent analytics cookie as permission to track.
Public page analytics, PostHog browser analytics, SmartLink analytics, and
public link-click analytics remain blocked until the visitor grants analytics
consent.

Strictly necessary cookies for authentication, security, localization, and
platform operation are not blocked by the consent system.

### Consent Cookie

| Cookie       | Values                                    | Lifetime |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `sl_consent` | Versioned JSON category/timestamp record  | 180 days |
| `sl_ac`      | `1` = analytics accepted · `0` = rejected | 180 days |

- Set by `ConsentManager`
- Absent/expired cookie = no optional analytics consent
- Read server-side in `public-api.ts` and SmartLink redirects → forwarded as
  `X-SL-AC` header → persisted as `has_tracking_consent` only when events are
  allowed

### PostHog

- **Client-side**: `PostHogProvider` initializes PostHog only after analytics
  consent; `isAnalyticsAllowed()` gates all `ph.capture()` calls in `track.ts`.
- **Server-side**: public PostHog events are not fired unless analytics consent
  is present, and bot/internal/QA traffic is still filtered.

## QA Mode

Append `?sl_qa=1` to any public artist page URL to enter QA mode:

1. `QaModeInitializer` (client component) reads the param and sets `sl_qa=1` session cookie
2. On subsequent requests, `public-api.ts` reads the cookie and forwards `X-SL-QA: 1`
3. API resolves `isQa = true` → events are excluded from dashboard aggregations
4. QA mode ends when the browser tab/session closes (session cookie, no Max-Age)

## Data Retention

Raw events (including bots, QA, internal) are **never deleted** automatically. The quality flags allow retroactive re-analysis as filtering heuristics improve. A data retention policy (e.g. delete events older than 2 years) can be implemented independently without changing the filtering logic.

---

## Known Limitations and Risks

### Metric discontinuity after T4-4 deploy

Pre-T4-4:

- `page_view` events from bots were silently dropped at ingestion (the old `isBotUserAgent` check in `public-pages.service.ts`).
- `link_click` events had no UA-based bot filter — all clicks were persisted and counted.

Post-T4-4:

- All events are persisted with flags; bot events are excluded at query time.

**Consequence**: artists who had bot link-click traffic before T4-4 will see a step-down in link click counts after deploy. This is a data quality improvement, not a real drop in engagement. Include this explanation in the release note.

### QA mode is unauthenticated (intentional)

Any visitor who appends `?sl_qa=1` to an artist page URL can tag their own traffic as QA and exclude it from the artist's metrics. This is accepted for MVP because:

- The only consequence is self-exclusion (the visitor can't affect other visitors' events).
- There is no adversarial incentive to hide your own visits from an artist's dashboard.
- Proper authentication (JWT-signed QA tokens, IP allowlisting) is out of scope.

**Operational rule**: never share URLs containing `?sl_qa=1` publicly. Treat it as an internal testing tool.

Exit QA mode with `?sl_qa=0`.

### `isInternal` flag is a stub (not yet implemented)

The `isInternal` column exists in the DB and is always `false`. The `X-SL-Internal: 1` header that would set it is not forwarded by any part of the web tier. It is intentionally excluded from `QUALITY_FILTER` until the dashboard "Preview page" feature is implemented to avoid a misleading no-op filter condition.

### ISR will break page_view counting

`public-api.ts` uses `cache: 'no-store'`. If ISR is enabled (`revalidate: N`), the API backend only receives the fetch during revalidation — not on every visitor request. `page_view` events would stop being counted accurately. Before enabling ISR, move page_view tracking to a client-side call (browser → API directly) or a Middleware-layer counter.
